JKali fixes programs by doing three things:

1. Adding return statements
2. Replace conditions with true or false
3. delete single line or a block of code

Pattern file add_rtrn.xml takes care of number 1.
    we search for return statements with which has been added.


Pattern file false.xml and true.xml takes care of number 2.
    we search for conditions which have been replaced with true or false value.

Pattern file del.xml takes care of number 3.
        we searched for deleted statements.





NPEfix fixes the program by :

1.local injection of an existing compatible object
2.global injection of an existing compatible object
3.local injection of a new object
4.global injection of a new object

5.skip statement
6.return a null to caller
7.return a new object to caller
8.return an existing compatible object to caller
9.return to caller (void method)

I added two pattern files which checks for a variable being inserted or updated (1-4) and another one to check for insertion of return. (5-9)
