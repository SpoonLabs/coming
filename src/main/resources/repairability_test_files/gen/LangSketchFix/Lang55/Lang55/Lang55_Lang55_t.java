/**
 * <p><code>StopWatch</code> provides a convenient API for timings.</p>
 * 
 * <p>To start the watch, call {@link #start()}. At this point you can:</p>
 * <ul>
 *  <li>{@link #split()} the watch to get the time whilst the watch continues in the
 *   background. {@link #unsplit()} will remove the effect of the split. At this point,
 *   these three options are available again.</li>
 *  <li>{@link #suspend()} the watch to pause it. {@link #resume()} allows the watch
 *   to continue. Any time between the suspend and resume will not be counted in
 *   the total. At this point, these three options are available again.</li>
 *  <li>{@link #stop()} the watch to complete the timing session.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>It is intended that the output methods {@link #toString()} and {@link #getTime()}
 * should only be called after stop, split or suspend, however a suitable result will
 * be returned at other points.</p>
 *
 * <p>NOTE: As from v2.1, the methods protect against inappropriate calls.
 * Thus you cannot now call stop before start, resume before suspend or
 * unsplit before split.</p>
 *
 * <p>1. split(), suspend(), or stop() cannot be invoked twice<br />
 * 2. unsplit() may only be called if the watch has been split()<br />
 * 3. resume() may only be called if the watch has been suspend()<br />
 * 4. start() cannot be called twice without calling reset()</p>
